          'Nagarkhana,' and houses a marble idol of Ganesha with Riddhi-siddhi.
          Surrounding the main temple are four smaller temples dedicated to
          Chintamaneshwar, Chintamaneshwari, Suryanarayana, and Laxminarayan,
          collectively known as Ganapati Panchayat. Ganeshotsav is celebrated
          annually for five days with various cultural programs.
